### What is the Difference between Numpy Array and Python List
Numpy arrays are similar to python list in essence but they can do much more than lists.\
Here Are Some Benefits of Using Numpy Array Over Python List.
1. Numpy Arrays Can Perfrom Much More Mathematical Computation than Lists.
2. Numpy Function and routines are written in C++ and C so it has the speed of C++ and Syntax of Python which makes them easy to use and highly efficient in operation.
3. Numpy Arrays Have Fixed Size (when creating) and uses less memory Unlike Lists Which Are Dynamic in Size and reqire large memory.
4. Elements in numpy array must have same dtype and if you put other dtype then it will be casted to upper dtype(more on this later in this series).
5. Data is stored in continous memory location in numpy array
6. Numpy arrays also support element-wise operations on arrays.
